# Tests

## Purpose

The `tests` directory contains the verification assets for XeniosAI.

Testing ensures that business logic, APIs, AI integrations, prompts, schemas, and deployment configurations remain reliable as the platform evolves.

Testing is treated as a first-class engineering discipline rather than an afterthought.

## Planned Contents

- Unit Tests
- Integration Tests
- End-to-End Tests
- API Contract Tests
- AI Evaluation Tests
- Prompt Regression Tests
- Performance Tests
- Security Tests
- Load Tests
- Deployment Verification

## Design Principles

- Every feature should have automated tests.
- Business logic must be deterministic and testable.
- AI behavior should be evaluated using repeatable evaluation suites.
- Tests should run automatically in CI/CD pipelines.
- Production defects should result in new regression tests.

## Test Pyramid
